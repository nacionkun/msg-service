Limitations

- need to split into classes: mongodb data adapter and flask app
- class split would be better scenario to mock mongodb and unit test flask app
- unit tests and rest api tests not created
- single message delete limited only to message selection
- fetch message/s function not ordered
- package versions requirements (in dockerfile) are not version specific
- running flask app is not automated
